# Data_Structure Learning
Welcome to **Data_Structures_Learning** — a personal repository where I document and practice key concepts of Data structures through hands-on CPP programs.
This collection includes short, focused programs that demonstrate my understanding of Data Structures.

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a chain of nodes that are connected to one another using pointers. Each node in a linked list has the following two things –
Data: Value stored in Linked List Data Structure
Next Pointer: Contains the address to the next node
### 1. Single Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) points to the next node in the sequence.
#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Insertion, display, Deletion.
- Reverse Linked List
- Find middle node

## Stacks
Stack is one of the basic linear Data structure, that we use for storing our data. Data in a stack is stored in a serialized manner. Stack is that the data first entered in the stack will be at the last of the stack. This is one of the reason why we also called Stack a LIFO Data Structure, i.e; Last in First Out.
#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Implementation of Stack using array
- Implementation of Stack using linked list
- Infix to Postfix Conversion
- Infix to Prefix Conversion
- Postfix Evaluation
- Prefix Evaluation
- Balanced Paranthesis

## Queue
A Queue is another type of Data Structure, generally done via arrays. Generally, Queues are FIFO i.e. First in First out. A good example would be people standing at a billing counter in a queue, the person who comes first, will be served first.
#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Implementation of Circular Queues using array

## Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure, which has one root node and multiple child nodes(branches). Unlike, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks or queues, a Tree is non linear data structure.
### 1. Binary Tree
A binary tree can be defined as a finite set of elements, which can either be empty or have at most two children. The first subset constitutes of a single element called the root. The other two subsets are namely, left child and a right child. These subsets can be empty.
#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Building Binary Tree from preorder.
- Traversing Binary Tree in Preorder.
- Building Binary Tree from postorder.
- Traversing Binary Tree in Postorder.
- Traversing Binary Tree in Inorer.
### 2. Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a tree in which the data in left subtree is less than the root and the data in right subtree is greater than the root.
#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Insert, Delete, Search
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversal
- Find minimum and maximum
- Find height and number of nodes in tree
