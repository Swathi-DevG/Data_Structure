# Data_Structure Learning
Welcome to **Data_Structures_Learning** ‚Äî a personal repository where I document and practice key concepts of Data structures through hands-on CPP programs.
This collection includes short, focused programs that demonstrate my understanding of Data Structures.

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a chain of nodes that are connected to one another using pointers. Each node in a linked list has the following two things ‚Äì
Data: Value stored in Linked List Data Structure
Next Pointer: Contains the address to the next node
### 1. Single Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) points to the next node in the sequence.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- Insertion, display, Deletion.
- Reverse Linked List
- Find middle node

## Stacks
Stack is one of the basic linear Data structure, that we use for storing our data. Data in a stack is stored in a serialized manner. Stack is that the data first entered in the stack will be at the last of the stack. This is one of the reason why we also called Stack a LIFO Data Structure, i.e; Last in First Out.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- Implementation of Stack using array
- Implementation of Stack using linked list
- Infix to Postfix Conversion
- Infix to Prefix Conversion
- Postfix Evaluation
- Prefix Evaluation
- Balanced Paranthesis
